#EveSnapshot
EveSnapshot is a utility for Eve Online to save and restore UI configurations across multiple clients.

##Instructions
Enter the Eve Online settings directory (ie, `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\CCP\EVE\c_program_files_(x86)_ccp_eve_tranquility\settings`)  into the "Eve Settings Path" field. 

EveSnapshot will automatically detect characters based on the configuration files found.

The configuration for a given client can then be saved by creating a new profile from a selected character. Configurations can be applied to a character by loading a profile.
